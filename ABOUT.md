# Wordle Game using React.js and JSON Server
## A simple word-guessing game.

This project is a look alike of the original Wordle Game of the New York Times.This project was build using React.js and JSON server.
### How the app works :-
* 👉 React is used to handle events like current guess, matching the guess, adding color to the guess based on its positions, etc.
* 👉 JSON server is used to serve up the words for the game.
* 👉 Using the keyboard, we type in the guesses and on pressing enter, the guess colors up accordingly.
* 👉 If you manage to complete the game within 6 guesses, you win and you get a pop-up message. On crossing 6 guesses, you loose and get a pop-up message.

### For simplicity, I already provided the answer. You just pplay around it to see the working of the game.
